The material in the course builds on that knowledge via a series of semantics preserving transformations that start with a fairly high-level programming language and culminate in machine code.

Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can\'t do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture since hardware relies on software to realize its potential.

While the main focus of the course is to discuss critical issues, there will also be an emphasis on public policy and political science writing formats, styles and standards. It cannot be emphasized enough how important research, analytic and writing skills are to virtually all careers; nothing is more quickly discrediting of good ideas than bad writing. The first half of class is mainly lecture and discussion. The second half of class has been designed to promote your learning as a writer and thinker in public policy. It will provide students with a designated forum for developing and \u201cwork shopping\u201d their written work and discussing issues covered in class. The TA will offer feedback on questions as students write, edit, and revise their papers. We will also frequently practice skills in responding critically to colleagues\u2019 texts.

Correlations help to predict outcomes, but if we want to influence outcomes we need to understand causal pathways. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (\u201chappiness\u201d) are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people\u2019s lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions \u2013 factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis.","prereqs":"ECON 202-0 (Intro to Microeconomics) and a 200-level statistics class (SESP 210-0, STAT 202-0, STAT 210-0 and PSYCH 201-0 are all suitable)","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"024203"},{"id":"SOC_POL 351-0","name":"Special Topics in Social Policy","units":"1.00","repeatable":true,"description":"Advanced work on special topics.","offered":"012","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"015787"},{"id":"SOCIOL 101-6","name":"First-Year Seminar","units":"1.00","repeatable":true,"description":"","offered":"012","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"003305"},{"id":"SOCIOL 110-0","name":"Introduction to Sociology","units":"1.00","repeatable":false,"description":"Broad overview of a wide range of social issues and ways of sociological thinking.
