This course is reserved for students pursuing the McCormick Data Science and Engineering Minor. We encourage students to take this course at the end of their studies in the minor. It is the second part of a two-part sequence with DATA_ENG 200-0. DATA_ENG 300-0 has a \u201cflipped classroom\u201d format. Students are responsible for watching a lecture before each class. Then they will work collaboratively with their teams, the instructor, and course staff to learn how to solve various challenges in the data science pipeline.

Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders.The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today\u2019s workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what\u2019s important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there\u2019s a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well.

It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (\u201chappiness\u201d) are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people\u2019s lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions \u2013 factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis.","prereqs":"ECON 202-0 (Intro to Microeconomics) and a 200-level statistics class (SESP 210-0, STAT 202-0, STAT 210-0 and PSYCH 201-0 are all suitable)","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"024203"},{"id":"SOC_POL 351-0","name":"Special Topics in Social Policy","units":"1.00","repeatable":true,"description":"Advanced work on special topics.","offered":"012","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"015787"},{"id":"SOCIOL 101-6","name":"First-Year Seminar","units":"1.00","repeatable":true,"description":"","offered":"012","career":"Undergraduate","nu_id":"003305"},{"id":"SOCIOL 110-0","name":"Introduction to Sociology","units":"1.00","repeatable":false,"description":"Broad overview of a wide range of social issues and ways of sociological thinking.
